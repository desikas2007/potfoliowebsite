        Hi, I'm <strong>Desika S</strong> — a passionate Full Stack Developer who loves 
        building modern and user-friendly web applications. My focus is on 
        React, Firebase, and UI/UX design and a budding computer science and engineering pursuing my BE in CSE at KSRCE. When I'm not immersed in academics, you can find me creating sharing my knowledge and experiences with the world. I'm driven by a desire to harness technology for social impact, and I enjoy working on innovative mini-projects that can make a real difference in people's lives. I'm excited to share my journey, projects, and insights with you through this portfolio.
